    <h1 class="display-6 text-center about__heading mb-5">Hi, I’m Nicholas Martin, welcome to This Backpacker’s Life!</h1>
    <p class="about__lead mb-5">I have spent my life as a career bartender, but after COVID hit, I found myself out of a job, asking myself whether or not this was something that I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing. After a couple week road trip from Reno, Nevada (where I currently live) up to Seattle, Washington and back down; visiting National Parks, catching up with old friends, and some deep deep soul searching. I’d come to the conclusion that bartending most certainly was not what I wanted to do with my life.</br></br>
I spent many nights out in the middle of National Forests, deep in the mountains staring into the burning embers of that evening’s fire, alone, listening to my thoughts as the wind whispered through the trees. When I came to the conclusion that it was time to do what I really wanted to do, travel and see the world. 
I’ve spent my entire life traveling regularly. When three months had passed, I’d find myself getting antsy and depressed. So, I’d take a trip or follow a band on tour. As much fun as this was, I needed more. My pallet was wet and had to be fulfilled full time. </br></br>
I was born in Anchorage, Alaska, and I was lucky that my parents raised me as a traveler. We took trips two to three times a year as I grew up, while simultaneously moving cities every two to four years. By the time I was 10, I’d lived in six total states and been to two countries. </br></br>
I took my first solo international trip at the young age of 15, spending three weeks between Australia and New Zealand. This trip was with the People-to-People Student Ambassador program, so it wasn’t 100% solo. However, it was not with any friends or family that I new before the program. I can pinpoint this trip as the moment that I fell in love with adventure traveling. I climbed the Sydney bridge, repelled a 1000-foot wall, scuba dove the Great Barrier Reef, surfed, learned the sport of Rugby, and met with foreign diplomats as well as an Aboriginal Tribe. I even ate kangaroo and crocodile for the first time. </br></br>
Since I was only 15, it would be several more years before I could really try and surround myself with travel. When I was 19, I left for the Navy. I was really hoping I’d be stationed on a ship so I could get paid to travel. Unfortunately for me, I was put on shore duty and only got Biloxi, Mississippi along with the south, before heading to Norfolk, Virginia for some East coast action.</br></br>
After only two years I returned home to Denver, Colorado, where I began school at Metropolitan State University of Denver (or MSUD). Where I ended up studying Italian and doing a study abroad program that allowed me to live in Italy for four months. </br></br>
I used this experience to do the cliché European college backpacking trip and flew into Rome, a month early, to backpack for a month with the Eurail pass. I studied for four months, before backpacking for another month after the program had wrapped up. I managed to knock out 98% of mainland Europe in the six months I was there. 
Every weekend during the program I would check out a different part of Italy or take a cheap flight with Ryan Air to other European destinations. I went bungee jumping in Interlocken, Switzerland, cliff diving outside Marseille, France, hit up Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, visited the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, went snowboarding in Gstaad, Switzerland, spent Christmas in Venice, Italy, experienced New Years in Amsterdam, and soaked in the healing waters of Budapest, Hungary. </br></br>
About two months in I felt I could do this forever, but realized I had previous commitments back in the states. So, it’d have to wait. I spent the next ten years traveling on occasion trying to decide when the right time was going to come. </br></br>
During this period, I followed a few bands on tour around the United States, dipping off from time to time for the occasional international adventure. I visited Costa Rica and Nicaragua then a couple years later knocked out my bucket list spot hiking Macchu Picchu and visiting Peru. On that same trip I also visited Chile and Colombia for a total of three months. </br></br>
A couple years passed where I consistently tried to plan when the right moment to begin doing this would be. But every time I’d feel this or that was the right opportunity, I’d make up an excuse and procrastinate departing. I’ve finally realized there is no better time like the present. It’s time to stop putting off traveling for the perfect trip or the perfect moment.</br></br>
If there’s something we want to do or see, then I say DO IT! You never know when God’s going to come knocking. Let’s not go regretting what we get to see and do in this life. I mean we only get one shot at this and we might as well do it the way we want. It’s time for me to live my best life and I’d like to invite you along my journey through it!
